## A 3D boxing game with eye gaze interaction

This project aimed to build a 3D boxing game that uses controls for movements of the character, but also responds to eye movements of the player. So, when the player look down or up, the game camera looks downward or upwards. 

The application was created using the game engine Unity, with scripts in C#, interacting with the Tobii EyeX, the eye tracking equipment.
This game was created to evaluate the perception of players of different ages and conditions, when they had to use the eye gaze as element of interaction with the game 3D world.
